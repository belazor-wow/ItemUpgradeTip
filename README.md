# ItemUpgradeTip

ItemUpgradeTip is a lightweight, zero-config addon that shows the cost of upgrading an item in that item's tooltip. 

### Features:
- Displays upgrade information in the tooltip of an item that can be upgraded
- Supports character and account wide discounts for Flightstones and Crests
 
### Supported item types / currencies:
- Flightstone / Crest (Flightstone cost data and discount checking methodology taken from [10.1 Upgrade Helper | Wago.io](https://wago.io/upgradehelper))
- Honor gear (Honor)
- Conquest gear (Honor)
- Covenant gear (Reservoir Anima)
- Heirlooms (no currency shown)
 

Currently there is no plan to add Korthia gear to this addon, as Korthia gear is outdated and there is no benefit to spending any amount of currency to upgrade it.
